    "# 1. First just took an input and printed it.\n",
    "# 2. Tried counting total letters but was counting spaces and symbols too.\n",
    "# 3. Realized I needed to count only alphabet letters -> used isalpha().\n",
    "# 4. Tried to count frequency with a dict, used update(i) -> got error because update needs key,value.\n",
    "# 5. Learned I should do letter_frequency[i] = 1 instead.\n",
    "# 6. At first tried i += 1 to increment -> realized I should do letter_frequency[i] += 1.\n",
    "# 7. Output dict printed in one line -> fixed it with a for loop to print each letter separately.\n",
    "# 8. Wanted letters sorted -> added sorted(letter_frequency.keys()).\n",
    "# 9. Made it case-insensitive -> added i.lower().\n",
    "# 10. Added percentage calculation -> (freq / letter_counter) * 100.\n",
    "# Finally combined count + percentage in a clean print line.\n"
